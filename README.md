# Stock_Mining

In this web-scraping project we go over certain pre-determined 
stocks and gather information about them.

The site we are scraping for in Yahoo Finances since it contains long
history about each stock in a ordered and continent table.

The stocks are: S&P 500, Dow Jones Industrial Average, NASDAQ Composite, Russell 2000
Crude Oil, Gold, Silver, EUR/USD, Bitcoin (USD) and CMC Crypto 200 Index by Solacti.

We can, without much effort, add new stock to that list.
